In the program, the Integer rating is declared but it is not initialized with a value. 
When an Integer object is declared, it's default value is null. 
When the main() method calls on the rating() method, it returns the value of the Integer rating which is null, thus triggering the exception. 
To fix this, you can either initialize Integer rating with a value or, although this is not good practice and depending on the context, you can also change the data type to int and since it is a primitive data type, it's default value is 0:

Solution 1:

package com.moesol.hr.bugs;


public class Bug1 {
    private Integer rating;

    public Bug1() {
        this.rating = 0;
    }


    public int rating() {
        return rating;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("rating:"
            + new Bug1().rating());
    }
}

Solution 2:

package com.moesol.hr.bugs;


public class Bug1 {
    private int rating;


    public int rating() {
        return rating;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("rating:"
            + new Bug1().rating());
    }
}
